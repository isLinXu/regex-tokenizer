{"text": "way, `Do cats eat bats?", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 5}
{"text": "Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 7}

{"text": "earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump!", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 5}
{"text": "down she came upon a heap of", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 7}
{"text": "sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 16}
{"text": "moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "There was not a moment to be lost:", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 8}

{"text": "say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 15}
{"text": "hanging from the roof.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 4}
{"text": "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "wondering how she was ever to get out again.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "doors of the hall; but, alas!", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 6}
{"text": "either the locks were too large, or", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 7}
{"text": "the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 15}
{"text": "them.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 1}
{"text": "However, on the second time round, she came upon a low", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "she could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "very little use without my shoulders.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 6}
{"text": "Oh, how I wish", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 4}
{"text": "I could shut up like a telescope!", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 7}
{"text": "I think I could, if I only", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 7}
{"text": "know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "things indeed were really impossible.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 5}
{"text": "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "beautifully printed on it in large letters.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 7}
{"text": "It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "`No, I'll look", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 3}
{"text": "first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "for she had read several nice little histories about children who", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 15}
{"text": "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "later.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 1}
{"text": "However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 8}
{"text": "turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "it off.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 2}

{"text": "`What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "like a telescope.'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 3}
{"text": "And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "going out altogether, like a candle.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 6}
{"text": "I wonder what I should be", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 6}
{"text": "like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "ever having seen such a thing.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 6}
{"text": "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "and when she had tired herself out with trying,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "the poor little thing sat down and cried.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 8}
{"text": "`Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}

{"text": "don't care which happens!'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 4}
{"text": "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "her head made her look up in a great hurry.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}

{"text": "`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}

{"text": "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "`Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 6}
{"text": "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.  Alice", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}

{"text": "After a while she remembered that she still held the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}

{"text": "carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}

{"text": "few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "`Come,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 1}
{"text": "there's half my plan done now!", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 6}

{"text": "thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "with his knuckles.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 3}
{"text": "It was opened by another footman in livery,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 8}
{"text": "with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}

{"text": "heads.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 1}
{"text": "She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "crept a little way out of the wood to listen.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}

{"text": "together.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 1}
{"text": "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}

{"text": "out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "`There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "that for two reasons.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 4}
{"text": "First, because I'm on the same side of the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "or kettle had been broken to pieces.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 7}
{"text": "`Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "`There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "For", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 1}
{"text": "instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "`But", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 1}
{"text": "perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "VERY nearly at the top of his head.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 8}
{"text": "But at any rate he might", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 6}

{"text": "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "`--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "`ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.  `That's the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "first question, you know.'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 4}
{"text": "It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}

{"text": "`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "`What for?' said Alice.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 4}
{"text": "`Did you say \"What a pity!\"?' the Rabbit asked.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}

{"text": "`Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "two, and the game began.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 5}
{"text": "Alice thought she had never seen such a", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 8}
{"text": "curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}

{"text": "it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "difficult game indeed.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 3}
{"text": "The players all played at once without waiting for turns,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}

{"text": "a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "me?", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 1}
{"text": "They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 8}
{"text": "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 14}
{"text": "shall have somebody to talk to.'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 6}
{"text": "`How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}

{"text": "least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "The", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 1}

{"text": "no more of it appeared.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 5}
{"text": "`I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}

{"text": "walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "saw mine coming!'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 3}
{"text": "`How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "`Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}
{"text": "she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "finishing the game.'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 3}

{"text": "looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 8}
{"text": "`It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "`Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}
{"text": "like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "`A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've read that in", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "some book, but I don't remember where.'", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 7}
{"text": "`Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}

{"text": "screaming with passion.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 3}
{"text": "She had already heard her sentence three", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 7}

{"text": "she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 15}
{"text": "such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
{"text": "not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 9}
{"text": "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 10}

{"text": "`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 11}

{"text": "under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 13}
{"text": "a little more conversation with her friend.", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 7}
{"text": "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to", "type": "sentence", "token_count": 12}
